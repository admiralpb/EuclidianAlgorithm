In cryptanalysis, (arguably) the hardest part of cracking public key ciphers is factoring the modulus. And often, once that's been accomplished one -may- find the totient or Euler's "phi" function yielding the exponent necessary to decrypt the ciphertext. Most moduli are prime (i.e. their GCD is 1) and Euler's Algorithm can help confirm this.
